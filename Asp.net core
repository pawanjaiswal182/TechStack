Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential for allowing different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other over the Internet. 

**Key Characteristics of Web APIs:**  
1. **HTTP-Based Communication**: Web APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, with endpoints represented as URLs.  
2. **Data Exchange Formats**: Standardized formats such as JSON and XML are used for data transmission, with JSON being the most popular due to its simplicity.  
3. **RESTful Architecture**: APIs follow REST principles, including statelessness, standard HTTP methods, and hierarchical resource organization with unique URLs.  
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Security mechanisms like API keys, OAuth, and JWT ensure only authorized clients can access or perform actions on resources.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Summary**  

1. **Overview**:  
   - TCP is a communications standard for exchanging messages between application programs and devices over a network.  
   - It ensures reliable data delivery by organizing and transmitting data packets across the internet.  

2. **Key Features**:  
   - **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes and maintains a connection between the source and destination before transmitting data.  
   - **Data Integrity**: Breaks large data into smaller packets and ensures their accurate delivery.  
   - **Reliability**: Includes error-checking mechanisms like acknowledgments and flow control.  

3. **Applications**:  
   - Used in protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, email protocols (IMAP, POP, SMTP), and HTTP for web access.  

4. **Comparison with UDP**:  
   - **UDP**: A faster, connectionless alternative to TCP, used in low-latency applications like DNS lookups, VoIP, and streaming media.  
   - **TCP**: More reliable and robust but incurs higher network overhead due to error correction and flow control mechanisms.  

5. **Protocol Standards**:  
   - Defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is one of the foundational protocols of the internet.  



### **Steps in a Web Request and Response Process**

1. **User Initiates a Request**:  
   - The user enters a URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`) in a web browser or clicks a hyperlink.  
   - The browser interprets the URL to identify the server to contact and the resource to request.  

2. **DNS Resolution**:  
   - The browser resolves the domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) to an IP address via a DNS lookup.  
   - If the IP address is not found in the browser's cache, it queries a DNS server.  
   - Example: The DNS server resolves `www.example.com` to `192.0.2.1`.  

3. **Establishing a TCP Connection**:  
   - The browser establishes a TCP connection to the resolved IP address and port (typically 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).  
   - A TCP handshake occurs to set up the connection.  
   - Example: A TCP connection is established to `192.0.2.1` on port 443.  

4. **Sending an HTTP Request**:  
   - The browser sends an HTTP request through the TCP connection.  
   - The request includes:  
     - **Method**: E.g., `GET`, `POST`.  
     - **Path**: The resource being requested (e.g., `/index.html`).  
     - **Headers**: Information like `User-Agent` and `Accept`.  
     - **Body**: Optional, for methods like `POST`.  
   - Example request:  
     ```
     GET /index.html HTTP/1.1  
     Host: www.example.com  
     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0  
     Accept: text/html  
     ```

5. **Server Processes the Request**:  
   - The server parses the request to understand the method, URL, headers, and body (if applicable).  
   - It processes the request based on the URL and method:  
     - Retrieves files, queries a database, or runs scripts.  
   - Example: The server retrieves the `index.html` file.  

6. **Server Sends an HTTP Response**:  
   - The server responds to the browser with an HTTP response, which includes:  
     - **Status Line**: HTTP version, status code (e.g., `200 OK` or `404 Not Found`), and a status message.  
     - **Headers**: Metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`).  
     - **Body**: The requested content, such as HTML, images, or other data.  

   - Example response:  
     ```
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
     Content-Type: text/html  
     Content-Length: 1024  
     
     <html>...</html>  
     ```  

This entire process ensures seamless communication between the user’s browser and the server, delivering the requested resource.


### **HTTP Request Headers:**

HTTP request headers provide additional context or metadata about the request being made. They are key-value pairs, each sent on a new line after the request line. Here are some common request headers:

1. **Host**:  
   - Specifies the domain name of the server.  
   - Example: `Host: www.example.com`

2. **User-Agent**:  
   - Identifies the client software (browser or application) making the request.  
   - Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36`

3. **Accept**:  
   - Informs the server about the types of content the client can handle.  
   - Example: `Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/webp,*/*;q=0.8`

4. **Content-Type**:  
   - Specifies the media type of the body of the request when it includes data (e.g., in a POST or PUT request).  
   - Example: `Content-Type: application/json`

5. **Authorization**:  
   - Contains credentials for authenticating the client to the server.  
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

6. **Cookie**:  
   - Sends any cookies associated with the domain, used for maintaining state (e.g., session management).  
   - Example: `Cookie: sessionid=abc123xyz`

7. **Cache-Control**:  
   - Provides caching directives for both requests and responses to manage caching behavior.  
   - Example: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`

These headers help the server understand the nature of the request and how to respond appropriately.


### **HTTP Response Headers:**

HTTP response headers provide additional information about the response, including details about the server and the data being returned. Like request headers, they are key-value pairs separated by a colon, sent one per line after the status line. Here are some common response headers:

1. **Content-Type**:  
   - Specifies the media type of the response body (e.g., HTML, JSON).  
   - Example: `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`

2. **Content-Length**:  
   - Indicates the length of the response body in bytes.  
   - Example: `Content-Length: 138`

3. **Server**:  
   - Provides information about the server software handling the request.  
   - Example: `Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`

4. **Set-Cookie**:  
   - Sends cookies from the server to the client’s browser, typically for session management or tracking.  
   - Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionid=abc123xyz; HttpOnly; Path=/`

5. **Cache-Control**:  
   - Specifies caching directives to manage how responses are cached by both browsers and intermediary caches.  
   - Example: `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate`

6. **Date**:  
   - Indicates the date and time when the response was sent.  
   - Example: `Date: Mon, 17 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT`

These headers help the client understand the nature of the response, manage caching, handle cookies, and interpret the content properly.




### **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**

HTTP methods (also known as verbs) define the actions that can be performed on resources in a web application. Each method has a specific purpose and behavior. Here's a breakdown of common HTTP methods:

---

#### **1. GET Method**  
- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from the server at the specified resource. It should only retrieve and not modify the data.  
- **Idempotent**: Yes (multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request).  
- **Safe**: Yes (does not modify the resource).  
- **Has Request Body**: No (GET requests generally do not include a body).  
- **Example**:  
  ```
  GET /articles HTTP/1.1
  ```

---

#### **2. POST Method**  
- **Purpose**: Sends data to the server to create or update a resource. Often used for form submissions, file uploads, and complex requests.  
- **Idempotent**: No (multiple identical requests can have different effects, such as creating multiple resources).  
- **Safe**: No (modifies or creates data on the server).  
- **Has Request Body**: Yes (includes data to be sent in the body, such as form data or JSON).  
- **Example**:  
  ```
  POST /articles HTTP/1.1
  {
    "title": "New Article",
    "content": "This is the content of the new article."
  }
  ```

---

#### **3. PUT Method**  
- **Purpose**: Updates an existing resource or creates a new one if it does not exist. It replaces the entire resource with the new data.  
- **Idempotent**: Yes (multiple identical requests result in the same effect).  
- **Safe**: No (modifies the server state).  
- **Has Request Body**: Yes (contains the data to replace or update the resource).  
- **Example**:  
  ```
  PUT /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
  {
    "title": "Updated Article",
    "content": "This is the updated content of the article."
  }
  ```

---

#### **4. PATCH Method**  
- **Purpose**: Applies partial modifications to an existing resource, updating only specific properties.  
- **Idempotent**: Potentially (multiple identical requests should have the same effect, but the resource may change based on the update).  
- **Safe**: No (modifies the server state).  
- **Has Request Body**: Yes (carries only the changes to apply to the resource).  
- **Example**:  
  ```
  PATCH /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
  {
    "content": "This is the updated content of the article."
  }
  ```

---

#### **5. DELETE Method**  
- **Purpose**: Deletes a specified resource from the server.  
- **Idempotent**: Yes (multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request).  
- **Safe**: No (removes data, modifying the state of the server).  
- **Has Request Body**: Optional (typically not used, depends on server support).  
- **Example**:  
  ```
  DELETE /articles/1 HTTP/1.1
  ```

   - **Soft Deletion**: Instead of physically deleting data, it might be marked as deleted (e.g., by updating a column like `IsDeleted`). This can be done with a **PATCH** request.  
   - **Hard Deletion**: Physically removes data from the database, typically using the **DELETE** method.

---

### **Summary of Method Characteristics**

| Method | Purpose | Idempotent | Safe | Request Body |
|--------|---------|------------|------|--------------|
| **GET**  | Retrieve data | Yes | Yes | No |
| **POST** | Create/Update data | No | No | Yes |
| **PUT**  | Replace or update data | Yes | No | Yes |
| **PATCH**| Partially update data | Potentially | No | Yes |
| **DELETE**| Delete data | Yes | No | Optional |

These methods are foundational in working with RESTful APIs and managing resources on the web.





In .NET development, `dotnet run` and `dotnet build` are two common commands used in the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface). Here's what each command does:

### **1. `dotnet build`**
- **Purpose**: Compiles the application and generates the necessary output files (like assemblies and executables) from the source code. This command does not run the application, it only prepares it for execution.
- **What it does**:
  - Compiles the project code into intermediate language (IL).
  - Generates output files (DLLs, EXEs, etc.) in the `bin` directory.
  - If there are any compilation errors, the build will fail and show the error messages.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  dotnet build
  ```
- **When to use**: Use `dotnet build` when you want to compile your code and check for errors before running the application.

### **2. `dotnet run`**
- **Purpose**: Builds (if needed) and runs the application. It automatically runs `dotnet build` behind the scenes before executing the application.
- **What it does**:
  - If the project has not been built, it will invoke a build first.
  - Then, it runs the application using the output from the build process.
  - It is equivalent to running `dotnet build` followed by `dotnet <app_name>`.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  dotnet run
  ```
- **When to use**: Use `dotnet run` when you want to both build and run the application in one step.

### **Key Differences**:
- **`dotnet build`**: Only compiles the application, no execution.
- **`dotnet run`**: Compiles (if needed) and then runs the application.


So, Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API is a concept that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controllers and actions in your application.

If you open the Program class, you will see the following: It registered the Web API Services, AddControllers(), to the dependency injection container and also registered the Routing Middleware Component app.MapControllers() to the Request Processing pipeline.

For structured logging and rich log analysis: Choose Serilog.


In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core
In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core is a technique that temporarily stores frequently accessed data in the main memory (RAM) of the webserver to enable faster retrieval.

In-memory caching in ASP.NET Core is implemented using the IMemoryCache interface.

 // AsNoTracking(): Improves performance for read-only queries by disabling change tracking.
                countries = await _context.Countries.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
				


Filters in ASP.NET Core Web API are attributes or classes that provide a way to execute code before or after an action method processes a request. 

HMAC ensures that the data has not been tampered with during transmission by creating a unique hash for each message based on its content and a secret key.


Example: A Practical Scenario
You’re Sending a Message:
Message: "Pay $100 to Bob."
Secret Key: "blue dragon."
Combine the message and the secret key using HMAC.

Generate a code, like:
HMAC = 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j.

Send both the message and the HMAC:
"Pay $100 to Bob", HMAC = 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j.

Your Friend Receives the Message:
Your friend gets:

Message: "Pay $100 to Bob."
HMAC: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j.
They use the shared secret key ("blue dragon") to create their own HMAC from the message.

If their generated HMAC matches the one you sent, they know:

The message is authentic (from you).
The message hasn’t been tampered with.

Ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages. 




Microservices are an architectural style for developing software systems where an application is composed of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of the others.

Microservices communicate over lightweight protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, REST, gRPC, or messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

API Gateway is a middleware layer that directs incoming HTTP request calls from Client applications to specific Microservice without directly exposing the Microservice details to the Client and returning the responses generated from the respective Microservice.

Ocelot is an Open-Source API Gateway for the .NET/Core Platform officially supported by Microsoft. What it does is simple. It mimics masking multiple microservices existing so that the client does not have to worry about the location of each and every Microservice.


In a **.NET Core (now .NET)** application, microservices typically interact with one another using lightweight communication protocols such as **HTTP**, **gRPC**, or through messaging systems like **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**. Here's a breakdown of how services can communicate:

---

### **1. Using HTTP/REST APIs**
**Scenario**: A microservice exposes endpoints that other services call using HTTP.

#### Implementation Steps:
- **Service A** (Consumer): Makes HTTP requests to **Service B** (Provider).
- **Service B**: Exposes RESTful APIs using **ASP.NET Core Web API**.

#### Example:
- **Service A** (Consumer):
  ```csharp
  using System.Net.Http;
  using System.Text.Json;

  public class ProductServiceClient
  {
      private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

      public ProductServiceClient(HttpClient httpClient)
      {
          _httpClient = httpClient;
      }

      public async Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int productId)
      {
          var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync($"https://service-b/api/products/{productId}");
          response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

          var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
          return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Product>(json);
      }
  }

  // Register HttpClient in Startup.cs or Program.cs
  builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ProductServiceClient>();
  ```

- **Service B** (Provider):
  ```csharp
  [ApiController]
  [Route("api/products")]
  public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
  {
      [HttpGet("{id}")]
      public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
      {
          var product = new Product { Id = id, Name = "Sample Product" };
          return Ok(product);
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Using gRPC**
**Scenario**: Services communicate using high-performance, low-latency gRPC (a binary protocol).

#### Implementation Steps:
- Define the service contract in a `.proto` file.
- Generate gRPC clients and servers using **Grpc.Tools**.

#### Example:
- **.proto file**:
  ```proto
  syntax = "proto3";

  service ProductService {
      rpc GetProduct (ProductRequest) returns (ProductResponse);
  }

  message ProductRequest {
      int32 id = 1;
  }

  message ProductResponse {
      int32 id = 1;
      string name = 2;
  }
  ```

- **Service B** (Provider):
  ```csharp
  public class ProductService : ProductService.ProductServiceBase
  {
      public override Task<ProductResponse> GetProduct(ProductRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
      {
          return Task.FromResult(new ProductResponse
          {
              Id = request.Id,
              Name = "Sample Product"
          });
      }
  }
  ```

- **Service A** (Consumer):
  ```csharp
  using Grpc.Net.Client;

  var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
  var client = new ProductService.ProductServiceClient(channel);

  var response = await client.GetProductAsync(new ProductRequest { Id = 1 });
  Console.WriteLine($"Product: {response.Name}");
  ```

---

### **3. Using Messaging Systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)**
**Scenario**: Services exchange messages asynchronously.

#### Implementation Steps:
- **Service A**: Publishes messages to a queue or topic.
- **Service B**: Subscribes to the queue/topic to consume messages.

#### Example with RabbitMQ:
- **Service A** (Publisher):
  ```csharp
  using RabbitMQ.Client;
  using System.Text;

  var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
  using var connection = factory.CreateConnection();
  using var channel = connection.CreateModel();

  channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "product_queue", durable: false, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);

  string message = "Product Created";
  var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);

  channel.BasicPublish(exchange: "", routingKey: "product_queue", basicProperties: null, body: body);
  ```

- **Service B** (Consumer):
  ```csharp
  using RabbitMQ.Client;
  using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;
  using System.Text;

  var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };
  using var connection = factory.CreateConnection();
  using var channel = connection.CreateModel();

  channel.QueueDeclare(queue: "product_queue", durable: false, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);

  var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);
  consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
  {
      var body = ea.Body.ToArray();
      var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(body);
      Console.WriteLine($"Received message: {message}");
  };

  channel.BasicConsume(queue: "product_queue", autoAck: true, consumer: consumer);
  ```

---

### **4. Service Discovery (Optional)**
In microservices, service instances may come and go (e.g., in Kubernetes). Tools like **Consul**, **Eureka**, or **Kubernetes DNS** can be used for dynamic service discovery.

---

### Choosing the Right Method:
- **REST/HTTP**: Easy to implement and widely understood.
- **gRPC**: Best for low-latency communication between services.
- **Messaging**: Suitable for event-driven architectures and asynchronous tasks.

Would you like a more detailed implementation or clarification on any of these approaches?


the Run extension method allows us to add the terminating middleware component. Terminating middleware means the middleware which will not call the next middleware components in the request processing pipeline.


The Use Extension Method in ASP.NET Core is used to add a new Middleware component to the Request Processing Pipeline whereas the Next Extension Method in ASP.NET Core is used to call the next middleware component configured in the request processing pipeline.






### Practical Examples of Singleton, Transient, and Scoped in .NET Core

Let's build a **simple ASP.NET Core Web API** that demonstrates these three lifetimes.

---

### Project Setup
1. Create an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
2. Add three services: **SingletonService**, **TransientService**, and **ScopedService**.
3. Inject these services into a controller and observe their behavior.

---

### Step 1: Define the Interfaces and Implementations

```csharp
// IService.cs
public interface IService
{
    Guid GetOperationId();
}

// SingletonService.cs
public class SingletonService : IService
{
    private readonly Guid _operationId;
    public SingletonService() => _operationId = Guid.NewGuid();
    public Guid GetOperationId() => _operationId;
}

// TransientService.cs
public class TransientService : IService
{
    private readonly Guid _operationId;
    public TransientService() => _operationId = Guid.NewGuid();
    public Guid GetOperationId() => _operationId;
}

// ScopedService.cs
public class ScopedService : IService
{
    private readonly Guid _operationId;
    public ScopedService() => _operationId = Guid.NewGuid();
    public Guid GetOperationId() => _operationId;
}
```

---

### Step 2: Register Services in `Program.cs`

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddSingleton<IService, SingletonService>();  // Singleton
builder.Services.AddTransient<IService, TransientService>();  // Transient
builder.Services.AddScoped<IService, ScopedService>();        // Scoped

builder.Services.AddControllers();
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

---

### Step 3: Create the Controller to Test the Lifetimes

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class LifetimeTestController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IService _singletonService;
    private readonly IService _transientService;
    private readonly IService _scopedService;

    public LifetimeTestController(
        [FromServices] IService singletonService,
        [FromServices] IService transientService,
        [FromServices] IService scopedService)
    {
        _singletonService = singletonService;
        _transientService = transientService;
        _scopedService = scopedService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetServiceIds()
    {
        return Ok(new
        {
            Singleton = _singletonService.GetOperationId(),
            Transient = _transientService.GetOperationId(),
            Scoped = _scopedService.GetOperationId()
        });
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Application and Test

1. Start the API.
2. Hit the `GET /LifetimeTest` endpoint multiple times (using Postman, browser, or curl).
3. Observe the results.

---

### Expected Output (Example)

**First Request:**

```json
{
  "Singleton": "d8a7b9c7-4e21-4a95-a836-c9c8453e82b6",
  "Transient": "7f1d8c15-7f16-48ad-9ac3-0b816f93d334",
  "Scoped": "3bfbf6be-f4c1-44f3-a56c-112c3a7a7e5d"
}
```

**Second Request:**

```json
{
  "Singleton": "d8a7b9c7-4e21-4a95-a836-c9c8453e82b6",  // Same as first request
  "Transient": "c2fa3c22-b091-45a1-a4f6-f349b7b6c987",  // Different
  "Scoped": "b24525a3-648f-4902-a24b-ec243db02b48"      // Different
}
```

### Observations:
- **Singleton**: Same `Guid` for all requests.
- **Transient**: New `Guid` for each request and injection.
- **Scoped**: Same `Guid` within a request but different across requests.

---

### Practical Use Cases Recap:
- **Singleton**: Configuration settings, logging.
- **Transient**: Email sender, lightweight stateless operations.
- **Scoped**: `DbContext` in Entity Framework, business logic tied to a request.


To **differentiate between Transient and Scoped lifetimes** in practice, focus on **when and how often the instances are created**:

---

### Key Differences Between **Transient** and **Scoped**:
1. **Instance Creation**:
   - **Transient**: A **new instance** is created every time the service is requested (even multiple times within the same request).
   - **Scoped**: A **single instance** is created and shared for the duration of a single **HTTP request**.

2. **Behavior in a Single Request**:
   - **Transient**: If a service is injected multiple times in the same request, you get **different instances**.
   - **Scoped**: If a service is injected multiple times in the same request, you get the **same instance**.

---

### How to Demonstrate the Difference

Modify the `LifetimeTestController` to inject the services multiple times:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class LifetimeTestController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IService _singletonService1;
    private readonly IService _singletonService2;

    private readonly IService _transientService1;
    private readonly IService _transientService2;

    private readonly IService _scopedService1;
    private readonly IService _scopedService2;

    public LifetimeTestController(
        [FromServices] IService singletonService1,
        [FromServices] IService singletonService2,
        [FromServices] IService transientService1,
        [FromServices] IService transientService2,
        [FromServices] IService scopedService1,
        [FromServices] IService scopedService2)
    {
        _singletonService1 = singletonService1;
        _singletonService2 = singletonService2;
        _transientService1 = transientService1;
        _transientService2 = transientService2;
        _scopedService1 = scopedService1;
        _scopedService2 = scopedService2;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetServiceIds()
    {
        return Ok(new
        {
            Singleton1 = _singletonService1.GetOperationId(),
            Singleton2 = _singletonService2.GetOperationId(),

            Transient1 = _transientService1.GetOperationId(),
            Transient2 = _transientService2.GetOperationId(),

            Scoped1 = _scopedService1.GetOperationId(),
            Scoped2 = _scopedService2.GetOperationId()
        });
    }
}
```

---

### Expected Output

**Single Request Example**:

```json
{
  "Singleton1": "d8a7b9c7-4e21-4a95-a836-c9c8453e82b6",
  "Singleton2": "d8a7b9c7-4e21-4a95-a836-c9c8453e82b6", // Same as Singleton1

  "Transient1": "7f1d8c15-7f16-48ad-9ac3-0b816f93d334",
  "Transient2": "c2fa3c22-b091-45a1-a4f6-f349b7b6c987", // Different from Transient1

  "Scoped1": "3bfbf6be-f4c1-44f3-a56c-112c3a7a7e5d",
  "Scoped2": "3bfbf6be-f4c1-44f3-a56c-112c3a7a7e5d" // Same as Scoped1
}
```

---

### Observations:

1. **Singleton**:
   - `Singleton1` and `Singleton2` have the **same Guid**, as expected.

2. **Transient**:
   - `Transient1` and `Transient2` have **different Guids**, even within the same request.

3. **Scoped**:
   - `Scoped1` and `Scoped2` have the **same Guid**, but this will change for a **new request**.

---

This demonstrates that **Scoped** services share an instance within the same request, while **Transient** services create a new instance every time they're injected or requested.


The reason **Entity Framework `DbContext`** is registered as a **Scoped** service in .NET Core is to ensure proper **lifetime management** of the database context. Here's why:

---

### 1. **`DbContext` Lifecycle Needs to Match the HTTP Request**
   - In web applications, each HTTP request typically corresponds to a unit of work (e.g., fetching data, processing input, saving to the database).
   - A **Scoped** lifetime ensures that a single `DbContext` instance is used throughout the entire request, which helps maintain **consistency** in database operations.
   - For example, if you fetch, update, and save data in a single request, the same `DbContext` instance tracks changes and applies them in a single database transaction.

---

### 2. **Avoiding Conflicts from Shared State**
   - If `DbContext` were registered as **Singleton**, it would be shared across all requests. This can lead to issues such as:
     - **Concurrency problems**: Multiple requests trying to modify the same instance.
     - **Memory leaks**: Too many tracked entities in long-lived contexts.
   - **Scoped** prevents this by ensuring each request gets its own isolated `DbContext` instance.

---

### 3. **Avoiding Overhead of Transient Lifetime**
   - If `DbContext` were registered as **Transient**, a new instance would be created every time it is injected or requested. While this avoids shared state, it introduces unnecessary overhead because:
     - `DbContext` is relatively expensive to instantiate.
     - It loses the benefit of entity tracking within the same request.

---

### Example of Issues with Incorrect Lifetime

#### Using **Singleton**:
If multiple requests share the same `DbContext`:
- **Concurrency problem**: Two requests may attempt to update the same data simultaneously, causing unexpected behavior or errors.
- **Data inconsistency**: Changes made by one request might be visible to another before saving.

#### Using **Transient**:
Each operation within a single request would get a new `DbContext`:
- **Tracking issues**: Entity changes made in one operation wouldn’t be tracked by the new `DbContext`, leading to incomplete or incorrect data being saved.

---

### Why **Scoped** is Ideal for `DbContext`:
- Ensures **one `DbContext` per request**, providing:
  - **Consistency**: Changes are tracked and saved as a unit.
  - **Isolation**: Prevents cross-request interference.
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces the overhead of creating too many instances.

---

### Example Workflow with Scoped `DbContext`:
1. **Request 1**:
   - Fetch user data.
   - Update user profile.
   - Save changes.
   - All these operations use the same `DbContext` instance.

2. **Request 2 (concurrent)**:
   - Fetch a different set of data.
   - Perform some other operations.
   - Has its own separate `DbContext` instance, preventing conflicts with Request 1.

---

This is why **Scoped** is the most suitable lifetime for `DbContext`.









In **ASP.NET Core Web API**, **filters** are used to execute custom logic **before** or **after** specific stages of request processing. They provide a powerful way to handle cross-cutting concerns, such as:

- Logging
- Authentication/Authorization
- Exception handling
- Input validation
- Response caching

---

### Types of Filters in ASP.NET Core

1. **Authorization Filters**
   - Run **before any other filters** to check if the user is authorized.
   - Useful for implementing custom authentication or authorization logic.
   - Example: `[Authorize]` attribute.
   
   ```csharp
   public class CustomAuthorizationFilter : IAuthorizationFilter
   {
       public void OnAuthorization(AuthorizationFilterContext context)
       {
           if (!context.HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
           {
               context.Result = new UnauthorizedResult();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Resource Filters**
   - Run **before and after model binding**.
   - Useful for caching or short-circuiting requests before reaching the action.
   
   ```csharp
   public class CustomResourceFilter : IResourceFilter
   {
       public void OnResourceExecuting(ResourceExecutingContext context)
       {
           // Logic before model binding
       }

       public void OnResourceExecuted(ResourceExecutedContext context)
       {
           // Logic after model binding
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Action Filters**
   - Run **before and after the execution of an action method**.
   - Useful for logging, modifying the result, or validating action parameters.
   
   ```csharp
   public class CustomActionFilter : IActionFilter
   {
       public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
       {
           // Logic before the action executes
       }

       public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
       {
           // Logic after the action executes
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Exception Filters**
   - Run when an **exception is thrown** during action execution.
   - Useful for centralized exception handling.
   
   ```csharp
   public class CustomExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter
   {
       public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
       {
           // Handle exception and set a custom response
           context.Result = new ObjectResult("An error occurred.")
           {
               StatusCode = 500
           };
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Result Filters**
   - Run **before and after the execution of the action result** (e.g., `JsonResult`).
   - Useful for modifying or formatting the result.
   
   ```csharp
   public class CustomResultFilter : IResultFilter
   {
       public void OnResultExecuting(ResultExecutingContext context)
       {
           // Logic before the result executes
       }

       public void OnResultExecuted(ResultExecutedContext context)
       {
           // Logic after the result executes
       }
   }
   ```

---

### How to Apply Filters

1. **Globally**:
   Register filters in `Program.cs` to apply them to all controllers or actions.

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
   {
       options.Filters.Add<CustomActionFilter>();
   });
   ```

2. **Controller-Level**:
   Apply a filter to a specific controller.

   ```csharp
   [CustomActionFilter]
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class MyController : ControllerBase
   {
   }
   ```

3. **Action-Level**:
   Apply a filter to a specific action method.

   ```csharp
   [HttpGet]
   [CustomActionFilter]
   public IActionResult Get()
   {
       return Ok("Hello, World!");
   }
   ```

---

### Built-in Filters in ASP.NET Core

- **[Authorize]**: Handles authorization.
- **[AllowAnonymous]**: Bypasses authorization for specific actions.
- **[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]**: Validates CSRF tokens.
- **[ServiceFilter]**: Allows injecting services into filters.
- **[TypeFilter]**: Dynamically resolves filter types at runtime.

---

### Practical Example: Logging with Action Filter

```csharp
public class LoggingActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Action {context.ActionDescriptor.DisplayName} is executing...");
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Action {context.ActionDescriptor.DisplayName} has executed.");
    }
}

// Apply globally
builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
{
    options.Filters.Add<LoggingActionFilter>();
});
```

### Output:
```
Action MyController.Get is executing...
Action MyController.Get has executed.
```

In **ASP.NET Core**, the middleware pipeline is configured using methods like **`Use`**, **`Map`**, and **`Run`**. These methods determine how HTTP requests are processed and routed through the pipeline.

---

### 1. **`Use`** Method

The **`Use`** method adds middleware to the pipeline. It allows for both **request processing** and **passing control to the next middleware**.

#### Key Features:
- Can process requests **before** and **after** the next middleware.
- Passes the request to the next middleware using `next()`.

#### Example:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Before next middleware");
    await next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
    Console.WriteLine("After next middleware");
});
```

- **Workflow**:
  1. Logs "Before next middleware".
  2. Passes control to the next middleware.
  3. After the next middleware finishes, logs "After next middleware".

---

### 2. **`Run`** Method

The **`Run`** method adds a **terminal middleware** to the pipeline. It **does not call the next middleware**, meaning it ends the pipeline when invoked.

#### Key Features:
- Used for **short-circuiting** the pipeline.
- No `next()` call, so no middleware after `Run` is executed.

#### Example:

```csharp
app.Run(async (context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("This is the final middleware.");
});
```

- **Workflow**:
  - Writes the response and stops further processing.
  - Middleware registered after `Run` will **not execute**.

---

### 3. **`Map`** Method

The **`Map`** method is used to **conditionally branch the middleware pipeline** based on the request's URL path. It creates a new pipeline for the specified path.

#### Key Features:
- Routes requests to a specific pipeline segment.
- Useful for building **path-specific middleware**.

#### Example:

```csharp
app.Map("/hello", appBuilder =>
{
    appBuilder.Run(async (context) =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, world!");
    });
});
```

- **Workflow**:
  - If the request path starts with `/hello`, the middleware inside the `Map` branch will handle it.
  - For other paths, the request continues in the main pipeline.

---

### Combining `Use`, `Run`, and `Map`

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Use Middleware 1: Before next");
        await next();
        Console.WriteLine("Use Middleware 1: After next");
    });

    app.Map("/map", mapApp =>
    {
        mapApp.Run(async context =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Mapped to /map");
        });
    });

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Use Middleware 2");
        await next();
    });

    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Final Middleware");
    });
}
```

- **Pipeline Behavior**:
  1. For `/map`: Executes **Use Middleware 1**, then goes to the `/map` branch, and **stops there**.
  2. For other paths: Executes **Use Middleware 1**, **Use Middleware 2**, and ends with **Final Middleware**.

---

### Summary of Differences

| **Method**     | **Purpose**                                      | **Calls Next Middleware?**      | **Typical Use**                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **`Use`**      | Add middleware to the pipeline                   | Yes                              | Logging, setting headers, etc.       |
| **`Run`**      | Add terminal middleware                          | No                               | Terminal response generation         |
| **`Map`**      | Branch the pipeline based on URL path            | Depends (within the mapped branch) | Path-specific handling (e.g., `/api`) |

In **ASP.NET Core**, these two lines of code are part of the middleware pipeline configuration that helps handle incoming HTTP requests and direct them to the appropriate controller actions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **`app.UseRouting()`**

This line adds the **Routing Middleware** to the pipeline, which is responsible for matching incoming HTTP requests to routes based on route templates.

- **Purpose**: 
  - It sets up the infrastructure for **route matching**. This middleware examines the incoming request and determines which controller action should handle it based on the URL and HTTP method (like `GET`, `POST`, etc.).
  
- **When it happens**: 
  - This middleware should be placed before any other middleware that processes the request, like authentication, authorization, or response generation middleware. 

- **Example**:
  - If the incoming request is `GET /api/products/5`, this middleware will try to find a matching route template (like `api/products/{id}`) and determine which controller action (e.g., `ProductsController.GetProductById(int id)`) should be invoked.

### 2. **`app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapControllers(); })`**

This line configures the **endpoint routing** and tells ASP.NET Core where to find the controllers that should handle requests.

- **Purpose**:
  - It defines the **endpoints** for the routing system, telling it where to find **attribute-routed controllers**.
  - The `MapControllers()` method maps controller actions that are decorated with attributes like `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, etc., to the corresponding HTTP requests.

- **When it happens**: 
  - This middleware is responsible for the **final step** of the routing process. After the request is routed to the correct controller and action, it sets up the actual endpoints for processing.

- **Example**:
  - With this configuration, if there is a `ProductsController` with actions like `[HttpGet("api/products/{id}")]`, the endpoint routing system will map the incoming request to that controller action.

---

### How These Two Lines Work Together:

1. **`app.UseRouting()`**:
   - When a request comes in, this middleware checks if the URL matches any route templates.
   - If it finds a match, it prepares the request context by setting up route data and other parameters, but it doesn't handle the request just yet.

2. **`app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { endpoints.MapControllers(); })`**:
   - This part finalizes the routing decision. It tells ASP.NET Core to map all the controller actions decorated with routing attributes.
   - The controller actions will then be executed based on the route match made earlier by `UseRouting()`.

---

### Example:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    // 1. Add routing middleware to the pipeline
    app.UseRouting();

    // 2. Define endpoints for the application
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        // Map controllers to incoming HTTP requests
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });
}
```

In this setup:
- **`UseRouting()`** examines the incoming HTTP request and matches it to a route.
- **`UseEndpoints()`** executes the matched route by calling the appropriate controller action.

Without `app.UseRouting()` and `app.UseEndpoints()`, ASP.NET Core would not be able to map incoming HTTP requests to the correct controller actions.
